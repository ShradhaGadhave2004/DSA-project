# Image Viewer Using Linked List

A simple Java Swing application for viewing images from a local directory with previous and next navigation.

## Description

**Image Viewer** is a desktop image viewer built using Java Swing. It loads all images from a specified folder (`images` directory) and allows users to browse through them using "Previous" and "Next" buttons. The application uses a custom doubly linked list to maintain image order and display them sequentially.

The project also includes a welcome screen with a start button that launches the image viewer.

## Features

- Loads images from the local `images` folder automatically.
- Displays image name as window title.
- Navigate images using Previous and Next buttons.
- Responsive and simple GUI using Java Swing.
- Welcome screen before launching the viewer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or the ability to compile and run Java from the command line.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageViewer1.git
2. Ensure you have an images folder in the root directory of your project.

3. Add image files (.jpg, .png, etc.) inside the images folder.

4. Compile and run the ImageViewer1.java file.

### Running the Program

Run the main method in the ImageViewer1 class. This will display a welcome window with a START button. Click the button to open the image viewer window and browse your images.

### Usage

- Click START to launch the image viewer.
- Use Previous and Next buttons to navigate through images.
- The window title displays the current image filename.

## Notes

- Supported image formats depend on the Java ImageIO capabilities (commonly JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF).
- Make sure the images folder contains images before running the application, otherwise no images will be displayed.
- The application uses a custom doubly linked list internally to manage image nodes.
